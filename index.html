			<h2>Cameras</h2>
			<p><code>The cameras often serving a public interest, aren't connected to public networks. These sensors vary from monitoring vehicular traffic to recording water usage. Surveillance cameras are perhaps one of the more noticeable--and contested--forms of networked objects in public space. The public "connects" to surveillance networks all the time, albeit involuntarily, here offers a view into who controls some of the ubiquitous networks.</code></p>
